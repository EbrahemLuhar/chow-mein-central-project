# Chow Mein Central Project

## About the project

The Chow Mein Central project was made to look like a chinese restaurant website. It features a home page, menu, gallery and
contact page. The project was made to be visually appealing and using colours associated with chinese cuisine. It features
a custom made logo, full page slider and mobile menu animation made using javascript.

The project was built using HTML SCSS and Javascript. Gulp was used to compile SCSS to CSS, refresh browser on save and provide
an autoprefixer.

## What I Learned

This project developed my ability to make elements mobile responsive and improved my javascript DOM manipulation when
making the mobile nav icon. It was also my first time making a full page slider.
